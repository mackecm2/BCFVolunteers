# BCFVolunteers
Beer &amp; Cider Festival Volunteer Registration

Three components:

#Volunter Registration
Volunteers enter their data into a form (bbfstaff.html - NOT written by me!) which is processed and stored (formmail.php).

#Volunteer Download
Logged in users can view the volunteers online (volunteers.php), and download the data as a CSV (csvdownload.php).

#Organiser Login
Organisers can register, login, change their password, request a password reset, and logout.
